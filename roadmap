Suggested roadmap to develop and implement the **Toll Management System**

---

## ✅ **Phase 1: Requirements Gathering and Design**
- Identify functional and non-functional requirements.
- Determine key features like:
  - Vehicle registration
  - Toll booth management
  - Toll payments
  - Transaction reports
  - Error handling and validations
- Design the database schema (Tables: `Vehicle`, `TollBooth`, `TollTransaction`).
- Plan data types and constraints.

---

## 🛠 **Phase 2: Database Setup**
- Create tables with primary and foreign keys.
- Implement constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE).
- Index critical columns for faster queries.

**Tasks:**
- Create Vehicle, TollBooth, and TollTransaction tables.
- Define triggers for payment status validation.

---

## 🧑‍💻 **Phase 3: PL/SQL Development**
- Develop stored procedures for:
  - Vehicle registration (`RegisterVehicle`)
  - Toll payment processing (`MakeTollPayment`)
- Create triggers for data validation and error handling.

**Tasks:**
- Implement the procedures and ensure error handling using `EXCEPTION`.
- Test using sample data.
- Create custom error messages using `RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR`.

---

## 📊 **Phase 4: Reporting and Querying**
- Write SQL queries for generating reports:
  - Daily and monthly toll collections
  - Vehicle-wise payment history
  - Booth-wise revenue generation
- Optimize queries using indexing.

**Tasks:**
- Create sample queries for transactions and summaries.

---

## 🧪 **Phase 5: Testing**
- Perform unit testing on procedures and triggers.
- Validate input scenarios:
  - Successful payments
  - Invalid payment status
  - Missing vehicle details
- Test error handling and rollback scenarios.

**Tasks:**
- Create test cases covering all scenarios.
- Log errors using `DBMS_OUTPUT`.

---

## 🚀 **Phase 6: Deployment**
- Prepare the final schema, procedures, and triggers.
- Import sample data using SQL*Loader or direct inserts.
- Generate basic reports using SQL queries.

**Tasks:**
- Deploy the system in a test environment.
- Perform data consistency checks.
